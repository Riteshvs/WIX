# Wix-Website-Project
One of the first projects from Israel Tech Challenge Bootcamp. I was assigned and developed almost the pixel perfect website page as the home page of the official Wix Website using HTML and CSS without any libraries or frameworks.Â 

- Recreate the Wix website using HTML & CSS by inspecting their website with [chrome devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

- For your convenience, we provide you [a link to an archived version](http://web.archive.org/web/20200201073946/https://www.wix.com/) of the Wix website
the reason is that the Wix website can be changed while you work!

- Implement the website up to the 4th stripe (where the title is "Wix Editor Total Design Freedom")
