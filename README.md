# Wix-Website-Project
One of my first projects from Israel Tech Challenge Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It's completed within 24 hours.

I was assigned and developed the pixel perfect website page almost as the same as the home page of the official Wix Website by using HTML and CSS without any libraries or frameworks.

- Recreate the Wix website using HTML & CSS by inspecting their website with [chrome devtools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

- For your convenience, we provide you [a link to an archived version](http://web.archive.org/web/20200201073946/https://www.wix.com/) of the Wix website
the reason is that the Wix website can be changed while you work!

- Implement the website up to the 4th stripe (where the title is "Wix Editor Total Design Freedom")
